This game is based on the video game Dark Souls 3. It is a button click based game. 

The background, Fight button, and the fight update space is hard coded into the HTML, while the characters and their stats are dynamic to allow for ease of play. 

The code has examples of functions, and different if and else if statements along with for loops. There are also good examples of concatenation to include variables into the different p and h3 tags.
